# Webtoon to PDF
This proyect will try to be an easy CLI way to download webtoon episodes and compile
them into a single PDF per episode/season.

It's still on a very early stage and needs a lot of love to be funcional.

As of now, it has hardcoded the link to the webtoon I tested it against ([Tower of God](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/tower-of-god/list?title_no=95)), this needs to be changed soon.

TODO: Many things... Document stuff and remove all the hardcoded links is needed ASAP.
